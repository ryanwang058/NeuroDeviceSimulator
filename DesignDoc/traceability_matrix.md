| 1   | The Neureset system consists of an EEG headset with 21 electrodes connected to a handheld device which functions both as a signal processor and as a software interface for the user.                                                         | N/A              | MainWindow; EEG; Device; SignalProcessor               | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 2   | Pressing the new session option opens a timer that begins once contact is initiated, indicated by the blue light on the device.                                                                                                               | UC1              | MainWindow; SessionManager; EEG; Device                | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 3   | The timer shows approx. time remaining and session progress bar indicated by a percentage.                                                                                                                                                    | UC1              | MainWindow; SessionManager                             | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 4   | The user can press pause voluntarily during a session. If after 5 minutes contact is not reestablished the session is terminated and the device turns off automatically.                                                                      | UC1              | MainWindow; SessionManager; Device                     | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 5   | The user can press stop during a session. The treatment is terminated without data storage.                                                                                                                                                   | UC1              | MainWindow; Device; SessionManager                     | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 6   | The software calculates a baseline for each EEG site individually over approx. 1 minute, determining the average dominant frequency for that site, then applies the treatment over the duration of one second.                                | UC1              | EEG; SignalProcessor; SessionManager                   | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 7   | During that second, the green light flashes indicating treatment is being delivered. It then moves on to the next site.                                                                                                                       | UC1              | MainWindow; SessionManager                             | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 8   | At the beginning of a session there is an overall baseline calculated for all 21 EEG sites, concurrently, at the same time. At the end of the session, a baseline is once again calculated for all 21 EEG sites.                              | UC1              | EEG; SignalProcessor; SessionManager                   | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 9   | The menu also has a session log history. Pressing this button displays the time and date of the sessions and the user can scroll through them.                                                                                                | UC2              | MainWindow; Device                                     | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 10  | The before and after baselines are recorded and can be uploaded to a PC with the date and time log information.                                                                                                                               | UC3              | MainWindow; PC; Device                                 | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 11  | The baselines show the before and after dominant average frequencies for each EEG site, taken during the overall baselines at the beginning and end of the session, compared side by side as a numerical value.                               | UC3              | MainWindow; PC; Device                                 | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 12  | The third menu option is simply a date and time setting. The user inputs the current date and time so the device clock can accurately track the sessions.                                                                                     | UC4              | MainWindow; Device                                     | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 13  | The user is informed about the low battery status, and the user charges the device to ensure its continuous operation.                                                                                                                        | UC5              | MainWindow; Device; Battery                            | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 14  | If contact is lost, the red light flashes, the session is paused and the device starts beeping until contact is reestablished. If contact is not reestablished after 5 minutes, the device turns off automatically and the session is erased. | UC6              | MainWindow; Device; SessionManager                     | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
| 15  | One waveform for each of the 7 electrodes is generated during the treatment. The 7 waveforms should be slightly different, and they can be combinations of frequencies from the same band or across bands.                                    | N/A              | WaveGenerator; SessionManager; SignalProcessor; TestUI | Run the simulation in Qt to observe the UI |
